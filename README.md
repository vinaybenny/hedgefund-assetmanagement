# Hedge Fund Asset management

This code is my take on the paper titled [What is the True Cost of Active Management? A Comparison of Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1987512). The code is available both in MATLAB and Python, but this repository holds only the Python code, which forms my contribution to the research assistance on the paper. The code is dated Oct 11, 2013, and the repository has been migrated over from BitBucket into Github without the original history, due to confidentiality reasons. All intellectual property regarding the original research belong to the authors of the paper.
